### Problem Solving

A Cat, a parrot and a Bag of Seed:

Problem: The problem is getting the cat, the parrot and the bag of seed across the river 
	without complications.
Complications: The cat eating the parrot and the parrot eating the bag
	of seed.
Goal: To successfully get the cat, the parrot and the bag of seed across the river.

Start: 
	Acquire the parrot and take him across the river first.
	### This puts the cat and the bag of seed alone and the cat wont eat the seed.
	
Return to the cat and the bag of seed.
Take the bag of seed across to the river.
	### This leaves the cat alone
	### The bag of seed and the parrot are now on the same side
	
Grab the parrot a second time and take him back across the river.
	### This makes sure the parrot doesn't eat the bag of seed.
	
Exchange the parrot for the cat and take the cat to the other side of the river.
	### You are now going to take the cat across the river
	### The parrot is alone and the cat will be reunited with the bag of seed on the other
	### side.
	
Leaving the cat and the bag of seed alone return to the original side of the river.
Pick up the parrot and take him to other other side.
	### Now the last item from the first side of the river is on the other.
	### All items have crossed the river and none of have been eaten.
	
Say congrats to yourself.

Sock in the Dark:

Problem: There are 20 individual socks in a drawer.
Complication: You cannot view your selection until it is finished.
Goals: 
	A: Match one pair.
	B: Match one pair of each color.
	
Description:
	20 Sock, 10 black socks, 6 brown socks, 4 white socks.
	Have to choose 1 sock at a time in the dark.
	
	
Goal A:
	The smallest number of socks selected to guarantee a matching pair is 4
		### 1 black, 1 brown and 1 white sock. That leaves 1 sock to be either of those  
		### three colors.
		### With three socks you can get lucky and pull 1 of one color and 2 of another.
		### You can also get really lucky and pull just two socks of the same color.
		### 4 socks is the only way to guarantee 1 matching pair.
		
Goal B:
	The smallest amount of socks selected that guarantee a matching pair of each color is 
	18.
		### 18 socks being selected is the smallest number because you could choose all 10
		### black socks and all 6 brown socks.
			### This leaves all white socks available to which you only need 2 to make a 
			### matching pair.
		### It can be done with as little as 6 socks
			### This is relying heavily on luck and that you will be choosing 2 of each color.
			
			
Predicting Fingers:
Problem: Counting on fingers in an alternating manner going from left to right.
	E.G. thumb 1, index 2, middle finger 3, ring finger 4, Pinky 5, ring finger 6, etc... 
Complication: The numbers bounce on the index and ring fingers.
	E.G. index 10, Ring 20, Ring30, index 40, index 50, etc... 
Goals:
	A: Counting from 1 to 10
	B: Counting from 1 to 100
	C: Counting from 1 to 1000
	
Goal A:
	Index finger is where 10 will land.
	### thumb 1, index 2, middle finger 3, ring finger 4, Pinky 5, ring finger 6, middle 7,
	### index 8, thumb 9, and index 10.
	
Goal B:
	100 Lands on the ring finger
	### Index 10, ring 20, ring 30, index 40, index 50, etc...
	### This is the bounce complication I referred to above and had to manually count
	### each number up to 100 to make sure.
	
	
Goal C:
	1000 Lands on index finger
	### ring 100, index 200, ring 300, index 400, etc...
	### Counted counting the 10 count theory up to 300.
	### Learned that now when counting by hundreds it returns back and forth normally
	### between index and ring finger.
