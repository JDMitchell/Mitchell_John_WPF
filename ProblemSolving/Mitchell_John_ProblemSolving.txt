### Problem Solving

A Cat, a parrot and a Bag of Seed:

Problem: The problem is getting the cat, the parrot and the bag of seed across the river 
	without complications.
Complications: The cat eating the parrot and the parrot eating the bag
	of seed.
Goal: To successfully get the cat, the parrot and the bag of seed across the river.

Start: 
	Acquire the parrot and take him across the river first.
	###This puts the cat and the bag of seed alone and the cat wont eat the seed.
	
Return to the cat and the bag of seed.
Take the bag of seed across to the river.
	###This leaves the cat alone
	###The bag of seed and the parrot are now on the same side
	
Grab the parrot a second time and take him back across the river.
	###This makes sure the parrot doesn't eat the bag of seed.
	
Exchange the parrot for the cat and take the cat to the other side of the river.
	###You are now going to take the cat across the river
	###The parrot is alone and the cat will be reunited with the bag of seed on the other
	###side.
