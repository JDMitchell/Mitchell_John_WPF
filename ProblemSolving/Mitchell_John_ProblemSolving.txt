A Cat, a parrot and a Bag of Seed:

Problem: The problem is getting the cat, the parrot and the bag of seed across the river 
	without complications.
Complications: The cat eating the parrot and the parrot eating the bag
	of seed.
Goal: To successfully get the cat, the parrot and the bag of seed across the river.

Start: Acquire the parrot and take him across the river first.
	This puts the cat and the bag of seed alone and the cat wont eat the seed.
